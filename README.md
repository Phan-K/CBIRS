Content Based Image Retrieval System

This is a Content Based Image Retrieval System, written in C# and XAML using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

This program hosts a database of images. It allows users to select an image and sort the rest of the images based on similarity in terms of color values, photo-intensity, or both.
